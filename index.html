      <h2 class="subhead">Who we are and what we do</h2>
      <p>Nothin’ But Change is an initiative which is funded by the <a href="http://stong.yorku.ca/agents-of-change-project/">Agents of Change Project</a> at York University. Our mission is to raise awareness about homelessness in the GTA and accrue funds to help people experiencing homelessness. While it is important that our project is able to help the cause of homelessness, we place great importance on making sure that our project is sustainable for many years to come, and will empower people to make a difference against homelessness. In all, our vision is to provide leadership and support to end homelessness.</p>
      <h2 class="subhead">Why is this important?</h2>
      <p>There is a strong need for an initiative like this to take place, as poverty rates have been steadily increasing during the past 10 years. In fact, there are over 5000 homeless people in Toronto; 28% of them being youth. We hope to not only provide these people with the necessary aid they need, but to also educate the public about this issue.</p>
      <h2 class="subhead">Charity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Nothin’ But Change is a not-for-profit initiative. This means that <strong>ALL</strong> of our profit goes towards the charities we support.</li>
        <li>rom our sales of toques and socks, 80% of the profit will support <a href="http://www.360kids.ca/about-us/history/">360kids</a> and 20% will go towards <a href="http://www.raisingtheroof.org/About-Us.aspx">RaisingTheRoof</a>.</li>
        <li>As for the product we have designed – our high quality Nothin’ But Change t-shirts – 100% of the profit will support 360Kids.</li>
